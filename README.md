    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        I have learned to keep design more simple and organized. As I worked I realized that complexity was my enemy and I needed to change my expectations if I wanted success.
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        I started designing what I would want in a perfect world. As I went I decided that these expectations were not realistic and designed things to match the minimum criteria.
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        Simplification and organization are skills that I will use in all future projects.

    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        Creating modular code was very important in this project. Reusing previous work and templates improved the volume of my code.
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        Iteration was very important because each milestone built off of the last. My final project is a culmination of all of the skills I learned in the course.
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        Each milestone built upon the last and that was reflected in my code. I used the same base project and continually updated it to meet the requirements of the rubric.

    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        This course helped me practice some of the important concepts in coding such as reading code, troubleshooting, iteration, and modular coding.
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
        I am not sure yet but I am very happy with the experience I gained working with C++. I am not that interested in design but I am sure i will be using C++ in the future.
